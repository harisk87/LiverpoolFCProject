# LiverpoolFCProject
This project is an analysis of Liverpool's home performances over the past century. The goal is to quantify whether Anfield was really the "fortress" it was known as, with respect to other top clubs. 

All data is available freely at https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata

File: Liverpool.ipynb

Data: england.csv

# Accomplishments
-Installed PostgreSQL and linked it to Python using the psycopg2 package

-Studied basic and intermediate SQL from Mode Analytics

-Copied a CSV into a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2

-Used SQL statements to access different components of the data

# Future work
-Compare Liverpool's home performances vs their away performances, and visualize it over the years using bubble plots

-Compare Liverpool's home performances vs the average home performances of all teams in each season, and visualize it using bubble plots

-Compare Liverpool's home performances vs the home performances of the top 4 teams every season, and visualize it using bubble plots for average wins per season

-Get data for Liverpool's European performances, and add it to the database

-Compare Liverpool's home record against European teams in their best season vs other teams that were also in Europe, to see if Liverpool's "epic European nights at Anfield" can be quantified
